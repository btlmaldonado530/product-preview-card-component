## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

This was the first challenge that I attempted on Frontend Mentor so I choose a realtively easy one. But I feel as if I could have chosen a more difficult one and done well with it.

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids) - This helped me format the content in a grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. This site is also a good reference for anyone still learning or needing a refresher.
